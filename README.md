# About the project
This is a facial recognition program written in Python programming language. The project aims to demonstrate Supervised learning by implementing the DeepFace Framework. DeepFace is a lightweight face recognition and facial attribute analysis library for Python. 
The open-sourced DeepFace library includes all leading-edge AI models for face recognition and automatically handles all procedures for facial recognition in the background. If you run face recognition with DeepFace, you get access to a set of features: 
•	Face Verification: The task of face verification refers to comparing a face with another to verify if it is a match or not. Hence, face verification is commonly used to compare a candidate’s face to another. This can be used to confirm that a physical face matches the one in an ID document.
•	Face Recognition: The task refers to finding a face in an image database. Performing face recognition requires running face verification many times. 
•	Facial Attribute Analysis: The task of facial attribute analysis refers to describing the visual properties of face images. Accordingly, facial attributes analysis is used to extract attributes such as age, gender classification, emotion analysis, or race/ethnicity prediction. 
•	Real-Time Face Analysis: This feature includes testing face recognition and facial attribute analysis with the real-time video feed of your webcam.

# Model
While most alternative facial recognition libraries serve a single AI model, the DeepFace library wraps many cutting-edge face recognition models. For this project, the DeepFace library is based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) implementing the Visual Geometry Group Face (VGG-Face). 
A VGG neural network (VGGNet) is one of the most used image recognition model type based on deep convolutional neural networks. The VGG architecture achieves top results at the ImageNet challenge.

# Dataset
The VGG face recognition model achieves a 97.78% accuracy on the popular Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) dataset.

# Advantages of the Deepface Library 
•	It is lightweight 
•	It’s easy to Install Multiple Models and Detectors
•	Open Source Face Recognition 
•	Growing Deepface Community 
•	Language-Independent Package
